				<h4>How long have you been farming? </h4>
				<p>We never dreamed we would be starting on our own organic farm and succeeding someone but thanks to good fortune, determination, wonderfully supportive family and friends and a retiring farmer who saw something in us he liked, we bought our own farmland. It&rsquo;s coming up 3 years now. We now own an 83 acre farmland in a dream spot, since we didn&rsquo;t want to be more than 30 minutes from our hometown of Guelph. <br>We have so much support here not only from family and friends, but also from municipalities and government funding. We know there&rsquo;s a lot of people interested in this type of food and farming and encourage it to anyone considering a healthier lifestyle.</p>

				<h4>How do you market your product?</h4>
				<p>We offer a variety of different garden day camps and workshops to inspire aspiring gardeners to teach the basics of tending your garden or farm. We also try to leverage social media and our online presence especially because we are on our phones all the time, so we obviously understand the value in it. For those looking to try out some of our offerings, we have several different season veggies and herbs available, alongside fresh eggs, honey and seeds.</p>
				<h4>What is your least favourite<br> farmer related stereotype?</h4>
				<p>People think we work 80 hours a week, and that there is no way to make a living farming&hellip; that farming is back breaking work. I like to show people what and how we do what we do to prove it isn&rsquo;t true. Technology has advanced in so many ways, and find it strange that the common folk don&rsquo;t think that technological advancements apply in farming too.</p>

				<h4>How long have you been farming?</h4>
				<p>I took a one-year hands-on sustainable agriculture course at Fleming College. It was taught by farmersâ€”and for the past two years have leased property where I grew organic produce to sell. I initially wanted to be a chef growing up but quickly tired of working in fast-paced, pressure-filled kitchens. I began volunteering, and travelling. I gravitation to organic food seemed like a natural one. Having background in restaurant industry, I know how important materials are and nothing can win over fresh, high quality foods.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="stories_interview_col2"> 
				<h4>What appeals to you most about farming?</h4>
				<p>The fact is that it is a fundamentally good thing that we&rsquo;re doing. I grow food the right way to feed the people around me. I have no qualms around what I do at work and what we do in the world. I feel like we&rsquo;re bringing the world further. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to work for any corporation that is doing harmful things. Working for ourselves and doing something that is fundamentally good is a big draw. And the work is fun, diverse and fulfilling&mdash;as long as my body can handle it.</p>
				<h4>What&rsquo;s next for you? Advice for future farmers?</h4>
				<p>Never be afraid to ask questions. Seek advice. Reach out to those that know and the organizations that are out there to help you. <br>I have a mentor on call in the previous property owner John Sutherland, who literally came with the deal. I had it written in the contract that for the first year Sutherland, a retired landscaper and farmer, has to visit once a week to offer guidance. It was a clause he was more than willing to agree to, having seen something in the couple and their love of organic farming that he took a shine to. I met him through a community of Grown ON app and I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are many farmers willing to help just like John.</p>

				<h4>How did you get into farming?</h4>
				<p>I grew up in the suburbs, but my parents cultivated a love of the outdoors from a very early age with frequent camping trips across the country. I did well in school, went to university and got a degree in biology, and most of the people around me seemed to expect that I should become a doctor, scientist, or something of the like. Before a few years ago, I had not even considered the possibility of farming as a career&mdash;I had simply never been exposed to the idea.</p>
				<p>After graduating, I lived in downtown Toronto for two years working a desk job. I took the money I saved and travelled for almost a year, including a four-month cycling trip in Southeast Asia. When I returned, the city felt stifling and I couldn&acute;t stand the thought of going back to a &ldquo;regular&ldquo; (read: indoor) job. Whilst unemployed and trying to find a job I thought I might enjoy, I had a lot of time to think about my future and what I really wanted to do with my life. I had become very interested in food system issues, having studied ecology and food security at school and read some great books on the topic. This, combined with my complete obsession with food and my newfound sense of restlessness, led me to contact a farmer I had met a few years earlier on a whim. He offered me an internship position, and I immediately accepted. I didn&acute;t know where it would lead me, but I knew that there was no way I would ever regret the experience.</p>

			<div class="stories_interview_col2"> 
				<h4>What&acute;s next for you?</h4>
				<p>I&acute;m really eager to get some experience working with animals. My dream is to someday operate a fully integrated mixed farm. It seems to me that one of the most fundamental problems in our modern agricultural system is the separation of plants and animals&mdash;a separation that never exists in nature, and for good reason. We humans have tried to co-opt nature, and it&acute;s not working very well: animal farmers purchase plant-based products produced off-farm to feed their animals, and plant farmers purchase expensive synthetic fertilizers, which have devastating environmental impacts in addition to diminishing our already meagre profit margins. So I would love to spend some time working on mixed farms that are trying to close the gap.<br>I also want to work on engaging young people from non-farming backgrounds and exposing farming as a viable and fulfilling occupation. I wish someone had done that for me ten years ago.</p>

				<h4>How long have you been farming? </h4>
				<p>I&acute;m in my second season now, I am working as the Harvest and Marketing Manager. Farming has been so much more than I ever could have expected, in many different ways. I love working outdoors and don&acute;t think I will ever get over the magic of watching plants grow. But it&acute;s really the community and social aspects of farming that have surprised me. I have met so many wonderful and inspiring people and I can&acute;t imagine what my life would be like without them.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="stories_interview_col2"> 
				<h4>Wasn&acute;t it difficult to start the farming process, like buying land?</h4>
				<p>We never bought. We&acute;re still renting! There is a lot of legislation that makes it complicated. We are now working on buying a small piece, however we&acute;ve been renting from the beginning and it&acute;s a great startup option. It&acute;s been a great way to minimize our costs and use the land we have to it&acute;s fullest production potential. The farmhouse on the land was serendipitously for sale when we started the co-op. We went to plant garlic fall 2004 and on that day the house was put on the market. At the time, we had no idea where we were going to live and how it would work out we just wanted to do it!</p>
				<h4>What do you think the future holds for farming and farmers in Ontario?</h4>
				<p>There is more and more interest for our small-scale and medium-scale agriculture. I don&acute;t think it&acute;s going to be easy but I do think it&acute;s going to keep growing. Organics is the sector growing the most in the agriculture world right now. There is a lot of space for new farms. My hope is that one day we&acute;ll repopulate the countryside again and make for vibrant rural village life and get away from the cookie cutter housing, and shoebox condo developments. </p>
