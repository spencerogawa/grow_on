				<h2>Research Insights<br> and Drivers</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>In Ontario, demand for organic food products has surpassed $1 billion, and the market is growing at a rate of roughly ten percent annually.</li>
					<li>53% of Ontarians buy organic groceries weekly and 98% of Ontarians plan to increase or maintain their organic food purchase in future.</li>
					<li>Over the last two decades, the average age of farm operators increased in Canada, rising from 47.5 to 54.0 years.</li>
					<li>Less than one out of 10 farms had the oldest operator under 40 years old in 2011, whereas two decades earlier it was about 1 in 4.</li>
					<li>Even though Toronto ranked top 1 in 35 cities across the world for the government support and institutional framework for youth ages 13 to 25 years old, however, Toronto ranked in 11 in the categories of Education and Training for youth.</li>
					<li>Government of Canada has several programs promoting agriculture career such as Advance Payments Program and AgriStability, targeting between 18 to 39 years old.</li>
					<li>18 % of Ontario&apos;s Farmland has been lost in the last 40 years.</li>
					<li>Currently we are losing 350 acres per day.</li>
					<li>Only 5% of the land in Ontario can support farming.</li>
					<li>If current trends continue, Ontario will lose the ability to be self-sufficient in food within the next 20 years.</li>
					<li>Ontario farmland can produce over 200 commodities including tender fruit, vegetable crops, livestock, grains and oilseeds. These industries also provide 700,000 jobs and contribute $34 billion to Ontario&apos;s economy.</li>

				<h2 class="sc-title">Opportunity</h2>
				<p class="cs-regular-copy">The demand for organic food products has been increasing 10% annually in Ontario for the last several years, and in order to meet the demand, we are looking for immediate outcomes. People in their 20s to 30s change their job more frequently than other cohorts, and most likely to radically change their career goals. Majority of the people in this age group are mostly single or in early stages of marriage. Therefore they are in a more ideal situation to make major life transitions such as relocation to rural areas or a career change into organic agriculture.</p>

				<h1 id="cs-title-number5">05</h1>
				<h2 class="sc-title">Media choice</h2>
				<p class="cs-regular-copy">People in their 20&apos;s are more exposed to digital media than print media so design solutions will be digital base so that people can access it freely from anywhere and anytime. People nowadays have shorter attention spans and distracted by many things, hence impactful and concise design solution is strongly needed. Lastly, those who are health conscious and already buying organic products are more likely to share interest in the organic farming industry, hence design deliverables in retail environment would be an efficient place to reach out target audience.</p>

			<h2 class="sc-title">Solution</h2>
			<p class="cs-regular-copy">To create a strategy that makes the information about organic farming more accessible, approachable and visually attractive to our target audience. In order to reach out and communicate with youth in urban areas, we will do this with impactful concise design solution and creative design deliverables.</p>

				<h2 class="sc-title">The Design System</h2>
				<p class="cs-regular-copy">This strategy contains three main design deliverables, packaging design, web design and mobile application design. As supporting elements, video/motion graphics would be used to explain whole idea. This video would be used mainly on the website and social network. Lastly strong identity and branding strategy is essential to visually attract people and unite whole deliverables. Hence branding is also chosen as secondary design deliverable for this thesis. </p>
